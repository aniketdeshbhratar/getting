Angular
All application is set of components and services provide functionaliy across these components
-Angular component : contains template which is view, class where code is assosicated with view like data elements and 
methods like event listner
metadata - which contains additional information about comonent to Angular
-Modules - help us to organize application and functionaliy.
each app as atlest one module which is root module
also there is additional module which is feature module

Typescript : 
strong typing- which is we can define a type.
tooling - inline documentation, syntax check , code navigation , advance refactoring

[Q] what is advance refactoring?

-superset of javascript and compiles in plain javascript
-stongly typed: variable,function,function parameter have data type using .d.ts file
-class based object orentation 
-can use es6 feature

[Q] Where is start code
it is in package.json

++ Namespaces 
Modules to help organize namespace issues
[Q] what is namespace in angular/Typescript

++ ES Modules 


++ Angular Modules 
Atleast one angulae module-which is app.module
share module - code which are used by multiple modules,can load on start or lazy module
feature module - group features 

++ component
Component contains template
-view layout
-created with html
-including binding and directives

then class
-code supporting the view
-created with Typescript
-properties data methods and logic

metadata
-to find metadata use selector,template url,style
-@Component

++  Bootstraping - self starting 
- tell angular to load our root component 

hosting the application
-in index.html we add selector, here it insert html which is define in angular component
angular module provide all information to angular
- imports contains all modules , browserModule
- declarations contains all components
- bootstrap contains startup component

[Q] what is use of browserModule ?

Angular directive are case sensative

++ installing bootsatrap and fontawesome

++ AppModule
Every app should have atleast one AppModule.
AppCompnent belongs to single component
it also brpwserModule to pull features which are need to be run in browserModule


[q] What is browserModule

++ Binding 
Co ordinated communication between component class and its template.
and template pass events to pass user actions or user enter value.
-Interpolation (one way)
{{pageTitle}}

++ directive
Custome HTML element or attribute to use to power up and extend to HTML
Build in Angular directives
*ngIf (structural directives) modifies the structire or view by manupulating children
*ngFor (structural directives) both are from (browserModule)

*ngIf=
products && products.length

** For of vs For in es2015
-For of-
iterate over iterable objects, such as an array.
let nickname = ['d1','d2','d3'];
for(let nick of nickNames){
}

-For in

Iterates over the properties of an object. can get index
0,1,2


++ Data binding 

++Property Binding
propety binding allows to set values of template expression.

<img [src]='product.imageUrl'>

[src] is element property and 'product.imageUrl' is template expression

++ adding Styles using variable
create variable in ts file
imageWidth:number = 50;

[style.width.px]='imageWidth'


++Event binding
(click)="product.imageUrl"

{{showImage ? 'hide' : 'show}}

++ Two way binding 
Template to class and class to template 
[(ngModule)] = 'listFiler'

++Pipes
transform bound properties before display.
build in pipes - date,number,decimal,percentage,currency,json,slice
Custome pipes 

- we can pass parameter also
<td>{{product.price | currency:'â‚¹':'symbol' : '1.2-2' | lowercase}}</td>
