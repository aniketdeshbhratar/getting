Angular
All application is set of components and services provide functionaliy across these components
-Angular component : contains template which is view, class where code is assosicated with view like data elements and 
methods like event listner
metadata - which contains additional information about comonent to Angular
-Modules - help us to organize application and functionaliy.
each app as atlest one module which is root module
also there is additional module which is feature module

Typescript : 
strong typing- which is we can define a type.
tooling - inline documentation, syntax check , code navigation , advance refactoring

[Q] what is advance refactoring?

-superset of javascript and compiles in plain javascript
-stongly typed: variable,function,function parameter have data type using .d.ts file
-class based object orentation 
-can use es6 feature

[Q] Where is start code
it is in package.json

++ Namespaces 
Modules to help organize namespace issues
[Q] what is namespace in angular/Typescript

++ ES Modules 


++ Angular Modules 
Atleast one angulae module-which is app.module
share module - code which are used by multiple modules,can load on start or lazy module
feature module - group features 

++ component
Component contains template
-view layout
-created with html
-including binding and directives

then class
-code supporting the view
-created with Typescript
-properties data methods and logic

metadata
-to find metadata use selector,template url,style
-@Component

++  Bootstraping - self starting 
- tell angular to load our root component 

hosting the application
-in index.html we add selector, here it insert html which is define in angular component
angular module provide all information to angular
- imports contains all modules , browserModule
- declarations contains all components
- bootstrap contains startup component

[Q] what is use of browserModule ?

Angular directive are case sensative

++ installing bootsatrap and fontawesome

++ AppModule
Every app should have atleast one AppModule.
AppCompnent belongs to single component
it also brpwserModule to pull features which are need to be run in browserModule


[q] What is browserModule

++ Binding 
Co ordinated communication between component class and its template.
and template pass events to pass user actions or user enter value.
-Interpolation (one way)
{{pageTitle}}

++ directive
Custome HTML element or attribute to use to power up and extend to HTML
Build in Angular directives
*ngIf (structural directives) modifies the structire or view by manupulating children
*ngFor (structural directives) both are from (browserModule)

*ngIf=
products && products.length

** For of vs For in es2015
-For of-
iterate over iterable objects, such as an array.
let nickname = ['d1','d2','d3'];
for(let nick of nickNames){
}

-For in

Iterates over the properties of an object. can get index
0,1,2


++ Data binding 

++Property Binding
propety binding allows to set values of template expression.

<img [src]='product.imageUrl'>

[src] is element property and 'product.imageUrl' is template expression

++ adding Styles using variable
create variable in ts file
imageWidth:number = 50;

[style.width.px]='imageWidth'


++Event binding
(click)="product.imageUrl"

{{showImage ? 'hide' : 'show}}

++ Two way binding 
Template to class and class to template 
[(ngModule)] = 'listFiler'

++Pipes
transform bound properties before display.
build in pipes - date,number,decimal,percentage,currency,json,slice
Custome pipes 

- we can pass parameter also
<td>{{product.price | currency:'â‚¹':'symbol' : '1.2-2' | lowercase}}</td>

++ Improve component
-Strong typing and interface
-Encapsulating Styles
-lifecycle hooks
-custoome Pipes
-nested components 

++ Strong tuping
-every property has a type , return and parameter have pipes
++ interface : 
-a specifcation identfying a related set of properties and methods
-use the interface as a data-type
-for development only

export interface IProduct {
     
}

we have to import interface to use it.

and use it as 

products: IProduct[] = [{},{}]

++ Encapsulating Component Styles

++ LifeCycle
Componet has a lifecycle manage by angular
- create - render - create and render children - process change when its data binding change - destroy
OnInit :- perform component initialization retrive data, after angular initialization data
OnChange : - perform action after change to input properties
OnDestroy : - Perfrom cleanup

1)To use lifeCycle hooks we need to implenents OnInit Interface.
2) Import {OnInit} from '@angular/core'
3) ngOnInit():void{
    }

++ Custom pipes 
Replace dash with space gdn-203

import { Pipe, PipeTransform} from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
    name:'convertToSpaces'
})
export class ConverToSpacesPipe implements PipeTransform{
    transform(value: string //value which we are transforming,
    character:string//aregument to perform transformation "spaces"):string//return type{

    }//method to traansform value and return
}
<td>{{product.productCode | convertToSpaces: '-'}}</td>

here 
transform(value:string // product.productCod , character:string // '-'):string {

}

After this we need to add this into app.mmodule.ts in declarations array

++ Filter data 
- using pipes
- adding filter in component 
*Getter - data binding needs value it calls getter
*Setter - every user modifies the value data binding calls the setting passing in the setter value

  _listFilter: string;

    get listFilter(): string {
      return this._listFilter;
    }

    set listFilter(value:string) {
      this._listFilter = value // everytime the value is change we can add here
      this.filteredProducts = this.listFilter ? this.performFilter(this.listFilter) : this.products;
    }

++Nested component
to add component to any other component we have use component as a directive
-Register it with app.module.ts in declarations array

++passing data using Input() parent to child
create variable using Input() rating: number 
and use it as a property binding [rating]="" and pass the data
child.ts
@Input() rating:number;

parent.html
<td><pm-star [rating]='product.starRating'></pm-star></td>


If a neste componet to recive input from a container it should be expos property to same container
The nested component exposes a property it can use to receive input from its container
by using input decorator
 
++ Passing info from child to parent @output
it should be event
EventEmitter object to create event in angular
-first create new instance of eventmitter
EventEmitter<string> = new EventEmitter<string>();
-generic event payload string <string>
-generic event payload integer <number>
-generic event payload multiple values <object>

we have to use onClick() and pass emit method

1) First create click event in child html
(click)="onClick()"

2) Create a EventEmitter in child.ts 
@Output() ratingClicked: EventEmitter <string> = new EventEmitter<string>();
 
3) in child.ts create function which we have created in html
onClick(){
      this.ratingClicked.emit(`this rating ${this.rating}`)
}

4) add function into parent html, here @output variable shoud match with the function event caller
(ratingClicked)='onRatingClicked($event)' and pass the event

<pm-star [rating]='product.starRating' 
(ratingClicked)='onRatingClicked($event)'></pm-star>

5) add that function into parent ts file and caputer that data
    onRatingClicked(event){
     this.pageTitle = "Product List : " +  event;
    }

by using emit method we can pass data to eventmitter object which is ratingClicked

++Services
A is a class with focused purpose, those are independent from any perticular compnent
share data or logic across components.

Dependency Injection
Is a coding pattern in which class receives the instances of object it needs 
called Dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself

Steps to create services
1- Create a Service class
2- Define the metadata with a decorator 
3- import what we need

Import it from core
@Injectable()
export class productService{
  with some method which return array or logic
}

we can register in root and in component base also
just add providedIn property
@Injectable({
  providedIn: root
})

to register in specific compoinent add into decorator

@Component({
  templateUrl : './.html',
  providers : [ProductService]
})

This is good for tree shaking 

add calling services in construor and write in ngOnInit

  constructor(private productList : ProductService){
     } 
  ngOnInit():void {
   
    console.log('In Oninit');
    this.products = this.productList.getProduct();
    this.filteredProducts = this.products;
   }

++ Observables : HTTP
app request http to web servee, it retrives and respinse data to application then we process 
the data

Promises vs Observables
Promises: 
-returns single future value
-not lazy, by the time it is on way of resolved
-not cancellable
Observables: 
-emits multiple values over time
-lazy by default, untill they are subsribe
-can be cancel by unscribing 
-supoorts map,filtermreduce and similer operators
